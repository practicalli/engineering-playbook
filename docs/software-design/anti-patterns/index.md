# Anti-Patterns

Anti-patterns arise as people translate business needs into software solutions, especially where the human process requires a clear and well communicated shared vision.

Anti-patterns take a similar documentation style to the definition of Design Patterns, although anti-patterns can also cover behaviour so cover a far wider scope than the (mostly OO) software design covered by Design Patterns.

Anti-patterns are often inadvertently applied, so awareness allow those situations be avoided before they occur.
