# Practicalli Engineering Playbook

!!! QUOTE
    **Effective Communication** is the fundamental challenge for all software engineering projects

    John Stevenson, Practialli


The Playbook and Plays concept is used to curate a consistent information, so the right information can be found and used more effectively by all.

- A Play is a document that details practices and an approach for a specific task
- A Playbook is a collection of Plays that are related by topic, e.g. Billie Engineering playbook could cover the practices for deployment, accessing
databases, system integration testing, optimising builds in docker.

!!! HINT "Engineering Playbook Initiative"
    Establishing a playbook within an organisation encourages information sharing across teams and provides an effective way for disperate teams to learn from each other.

??? WARNING "New Book - content under development"
    Practicalli Engineering Playbook was started in January 2022 in an attempt to codify the last few decades of development experience, so this will be an on-going work
