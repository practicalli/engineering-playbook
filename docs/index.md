# Practicalli Engineering Playbook

!!! QUOTE
    **Effective Communication** is the fundamental challenge for all software engineering projects

    John Stevenson, Practicalli

The Engineering Playbook presents a collection of practical guides which effectively address common software engineering tasks.

- A Play is a guide that details practices and an approach for a specific task
- A Playbook is a collection of Plays that are related by topic, e.g. practices for deployment, accessing databases, system integration testing, optimising builds in docker, etc.

!!! HINT "Engineering Playbook Initiative"
    Establishing a playbook within an organisation encourages information sharing, providing an effective way for disparate teams to learn from each other.
