### Check SSH Key on GitHub

The [GitHub keys page](https://github.com/settings/keys) for an account lists all the authorisation and signing keys registered.

Each key shows its unique SHA, rather than the key value, for security reasons.

To identify if an SSH key is registered with GitHub, use the `ssh-keygen` command to show the SHA for public key file, `*.pub`.

!!! EXAMPLE "Show SHA of public key with ssh-keygen"
    ```shell
    ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/key-name.pub
    ```

Copy the SHA value generated by the `ssh-keygen` command and search for that value on the [GitHub keys page](https://github.com/settings/keys).




## GitHub tips

!!! TIP "Collapsible section in readme, issue or pull request"

    ```html
    <details>
      <summary>Click to expand</summary>

      Leave a blank space after the closing summary tag so that the markdown content renders correctly.
