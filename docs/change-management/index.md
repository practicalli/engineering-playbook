# Change Management

Change in any organization is very challenging and usually takes a lot of time or a lot of pain, i.e. evolution = time, revolution = pain (redundancies, people leaving, etc)

Consider change in others as a potential side-effect of the work I do, rather than a specific goal I want to achieve.  Having change in others as a goal can contain much frustration and disappointment.

Discovering what really motivates people is an interesting challenge in itself but a useful tool to create a meaningful basis for communication.

For an example, if introducing Clojure into a company you first need to identify what is painful or highly valuable to people.  Then talk about removing that pain or adding extra value when referring to Clojure.

I see a lot of people get excited about a technology for themselves, but they forget they have to help other people see how it benefits them if they want their adoption.
