# Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL is a domain-specific language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

SQL data incorporates relations among entities and variables.

Originally based upon [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) and [tuple relational calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_relational_calculus), SQL consists of many types of statements,[6] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly:

- [data query language (DQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_query_language)
- [data definition language (DDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_query_language) (schema creation and modification)
- [data control language (DCL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_control_language)
- [data manipulation language (DML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language) (insert, update, and delete)

SQL is a declarative language (4GL) which also includes procedural elements.

## SQL Syntax

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:

- Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries.
- Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data
- Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.
- Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.
- Statements, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.
- SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.
- Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.
