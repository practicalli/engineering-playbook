# H2

H2 is a very useful tool for rapid development as there is very little setup required.  H2 can be run in memory and data can also be saved to the local file space.

[:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Clojure Web Services](https://practical.li/clojure-web-services/relational-databases-and-sql/h2-database/){target=_blank} uses H2 to support a simple local development workflow.


!!! INFO "H2 is not recommended for production usage"
