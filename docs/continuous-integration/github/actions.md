# GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are pre-defined tasks that can be used within a GitHub Workflow, triggered by events such as committing to a branch or pull request.

[GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)  contains a wide range of actions that can be used to quickly create a workflow.

!!! HINT "Use major version only"
    Use the major version of a GitHub action within a GitHub workflows to minimise the maintenance of action versions in workflow configuration.  e.g. if the latest version is `v5.2.1`, then use version `v5` to use the latest version available within that major version.

## Authentication

GitHub actions have read access to repositories, allowing them to checkout code and configuration.  For more permissions the GitHub Action requires an authorisation token.

GitHub automatically creates a token that GitHub actions can use to make an authenticated API request, scoped to the current repository.

```yaml title="Use automatically created token"
      - uses: actions/action-name@v2
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

For customised authentication or access to a different GitHub repository, create a developer token and save it as a [user or organisation secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
