# Common GitHub Workflow Jobs

Common job configuration snippets taken from GitHub workflows, showing options typically used with GitHub actions.

## Basic workflow information

Echo information regarding the triggering of the workflow, to help diagnose issues should they arise

!!! EXAMPLE "Git Checkout Action"
    ```yaml
    jobs:
      workflow:
        name: workflow-name
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - run: echo "üöÄ Job automatically triggered by ${{ github.event_name }}"
          - run: echo "üêß Job running on ${{ runner.os }} server"
          - run: echo "üêô Using ${{ github.ref }} branch from ${{ github.repository }} repository"
    ```

    Add a summary of the workflow at the end of the configuration.

    ```yaml
          # Summary and status
          - run: echo "üé® Workflow name completed"
          - run: echo "üçè Job status is ${{ job.status }}."
    ```


## Git Checkout

Check-out the project from version control, fetching the whole history with `fetch-depth: 0`. Set `fetch-depth:` to 1 (or remove the option) to checkout the single commit for the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow

Echo the GitHub Repository that was cloned to the workflow log, to support debugging efforts.

!!! EXAMPLE "Git Checkout Action"
    ```yaml
          # Git Checkout
          - name: Checkout Code
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              token: "${{ secrets.PAT || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
              fetch-depth: 0   # fetch all history
          - run: echo "üêô ${{ github.repository }} repository was cloned to the runner."
    ```

### Sparse Checkout

Using `git sparse-checkout` can save signficant time by checking out a sub-set of files, especially from a large repository with thousands of commits.

`git sparse-checkout` always checks out all files in the root of the repository, so specify only the additional files and directories required.

!!! EXAMPLE "Git Sparse Checkout Action"
    ```yaml
          # Git Checkout
          - name: Checkout Code
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              token: "${{ secrets.PAT || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
              fetch-depth: 0   # fetch all history
              sparse-checkout: |
                docs
                overrides
          - run: echo "üêô ${{ github.repository }} repository was cloned to the runner."
    ```
