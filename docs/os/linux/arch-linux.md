### Split Packages

"split packages" are multiple packages built from a single source with a shared build process. Each package is defined in the PKGBUILD file

VLC is an example of a split package, where the media player is one package and the codecs for each media file type are in their own package.  Using a split package avoids installing many codecs that would not be used.
