## Packaging Standards

Deb package is a well defined standard that helps avoid conflicts between software and its package dependencies.  The standard ensures consistency across all packages.

RPM is a simpler package design and has less strictness for managing dependencies.

Arch is described as a rolling release, although occasionally the install ISO is updated.  Packages are continually updated in the Arch repository.  Arch User Repository contains community managed packages, each package is built from Git repositories.
