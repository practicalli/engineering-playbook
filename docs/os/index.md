# Operating Systems

!!! QUOTE
    Without an operating system, the computer is an expensive piece of electronics.

Guides to install and configure operating systems to support software development, graphic design and video editing.

## Linux Distributions

A Linux distribution is an assembly of software packaged to work together seemlessly (or atleast avoid conflicts).

There are a wide range of Linux distributions to choose from, although Practicalli recommends Ubuntu or Debian Linux distributions.

Arch Linux has solid community support should a more involved operating system experience be desirable.

!!! HINT "Practicalli recommends Linux"
    Practicalli recommends use of a Linux distribution to provide a stable and developer focused environment to work in.  The vast majority is freely available without cost and typically of high quality thanks to so many collaborators and users.

    Linux also has a quite minimal hardware resource use and has very widespread support for new and classic hardware.

    Unix/BSD based systems can also offer a good developer experience, e.g. MacOSX.

??? INFO "MacOS"
    MacOS is a BSD based operating system so has similar command line experience.  Coupled with Homebrew, a wide selection of developer focused packages are freely available.

    MacOS is often used by commercial companies (especially FinTech) as commercial software is used to administrate the operting system, usually by a remote System Adminstration team.
