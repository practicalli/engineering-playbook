# Code Quality

Tools can provide a base level of code quality and consistency when developing locally.

Those same tools can check important quality rules when sharing code via continuous integration workflows, focusing the scope of code reviews on the more valuable aspect of design decisions

- **Lint tools** identify syntax and formatting issues for a specific programming language or configuration file
- **Format tools** ensures code follows a common set of format and indent rules

The development team should agree on the rules that are valueable for these tools to apply, including those recommended by the community around the programming language or configuration file specification.
