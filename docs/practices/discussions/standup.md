- share only essential and important information


!!! WARNING "Anti-pattern: using standups for status updates"
    There are many far more effective approaches to track the status of a team.

    It is a waste of everyones time at a standup to talk about what was done and what will be done next.


Topics

- identify experiences that are useful to share
-


## Tips

- stand up at the standup, encourages brevity
- its okay not to have anything to share on any given day (never sharing should be addressed though)
