## Attentive listening

Attentive listening involves not only listening to the works and their underlying intent, but also observing tone, facial expressions and body language.

An empathic listener is one who listens “with the intent to understand everything that the other person is trying to communicate, knowing that words are only part of the message.”

## Regular Feedback

Provide positive feedback regularly to provide a source of motivation to the other person.

Provide constructive feedback as early as possible to allow the other person to action improvements before a situation may deteriorated.

Constructive feedback is a valuable experience when offered in a way intended to help.

Prepare what you want to say in advance and be as specific as possible, inviting questions and thoughts from the other person  and agree together a plan of action for moving forward.

Collaborative people should welcome feedback in return, encouraging others to tell them how they can better support them going forward.

## Consistency

Both people involved should have an appreciation of the value of the one-to-one meeting and regularly work to ensure the meeting continues to deliver value for both over time.

Avoid cancellation of the meeting without good reason and providing an explianation. Cancelation, especially last minute can signal to the other person that time with them is not as valued as it should be.

Transparency, understanding and mutual support are the rewards for regular and consistent meetings.
