# Code Kata

A code kata is a small coding exercise that you repeat over and over again, helping you improve your coding skills.

The kata is not about producing a usable solution as this detracts from the learning experience.

A coding kata for a developer is like an athlete doing warming up exercises before a run.

A coding kata is often used to warm up your skills before you start work each day.  Working on a kata problem that is not related to any of your work allows you to think about how you write code rather than thinking of delivery and meeting estimates.

Coding kata often uses a test first approach, as in TDD.
