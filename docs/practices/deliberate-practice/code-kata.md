# Code Kata

 Coding Kata
A coding kata is a small coding exercise that you repeat over and over again, helping you improve your coding skills.

The kata is not about producing a usable solution as this detracts from the learning experience.

A coding kata for a developer is like an athlete doing warming up exercises before a run.

A coding kata is often used to warm up your skills before you start work each day.  Working on a kata problem that is not related to any of your work allows you to think about how you write code rather than thinking of delivery and meeting estimates.

Coding kata's normally use a test first approach, as in TDD.

## Code Dojo

A coding dojo is a group event to help you learn a language, a framework or development technique.

At the coding dojo, a laptop is connected to a projector so everyone can see the coding taking place.

At regular intervals, one pilot and one co-pilot take there positions at the computer and have a set time to create a new test, implement code to fix a failing test or refactor the code.

The pilot writes tests or code whilst the co-pilot asks questions and discusses the approach they are taking.

If the pilot and co-pilot need help, they can ask the audience for guidance.
