# Deliberate Practice

People learn by doing. People need to do something many times before it becomes instinctive or ingrained.  

Deliberate practice is about doing something in order to learn rather than produce a finished product with all the presures that entails.

Deliberate practice is not aimed at being an effective way to develop a software product, rather training tools which encourage high levels of learning and improve skills effectively.

??? INFO "Academic Research"
    In studies of accomplished individuals, researchers have found few signs of precocious achievement before the individuals started intensive training. Similar findings have turned up in studies of musicians, tennis players, artists, swimmers, mathematicians, and others.

!!! HINT "Delivery can limit learning"
    Working on a software project under deadlines and other pressures detracts from what you can learn, unless you take the time to setp back from the "doing" and "deadline".  

    Most fundamentally, what we generally do…. isn’t designed by anyone to make us better at anything. Usually it isn’t designed at all: We are just given an objective that’s necessary to meeting the employer’s goals and then expected to get on with it.


## Kata 

Kata is a form of deliberate practice that uses repetative actions to improve skills.  Code kata involves solving different challenges or the same challenge in different ways.

[:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Code kata](code-kata.md) is used to implement different code solutions to the same design challenge.

[:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Architecture kata](architecture-kata.md) is a way practice creating high-level solutions to business challenges.


## Code dojo 

A coding dojo is a group event to help you learn a language, a framework, tool or development technique.  Ideally the scope of the challenge should be designed around what is most useful to learn each time.

Attending a coding dojo on a regular basis gains a lot of experience to become more effective when working on projects.  

Dojo experiences create a familarity and higher comfort level with pair programming, increating the levels of pair programming and promiscuous pairing happen at work.  

A coding dojo provides exposure to the practical experience of others, especially things people forget they know or do almost instinctively.

!!! HINT "Next simplest thing that can be done"
    Dojo events are only 1 to 2 hours long, so only doing the next simplest thing each time minimises the risk of analysis paralysis (discussing many options and paths without actually coding anything).

    By considering the next simplest thing that can be done, a specific piece of code can be written and evaluated once it has been created.  Then the next simplest thing can be done.


??? INFO "Classic style dojo can be challenging"

    The original coding dojo approach was to have a single laptop connected to a projector (or very large screen monitor) so everyone present can see the coding taking place.

    At regular intervals a pilot and co-pilot take there positions at the computer and have a set time to create a new test, implement code to fix a failing test or refactor the code.

    The pilot writes tests or code whilst the co-pilot asks questions and discusses the approach they are taking.  These discussions are spoken aloud so the audience can clearly hear them.

    If the pilot and co-pilot need help, they should ask the audience for guidance.

    > This approach can feel quite high pressure, especially when in a group of people that are not well known.


### Group show and tell dojo

Collectively identify one or more challenges to work on and divide up in to small groups of 2 to 3 people.  Larger groups tend to lead to disjointed discussions and very limited progress.

Each group decides how to tackle the challenge and takes turn driving the code.

Toward the end of the event, each group presents their design decisions and interesting aspects of the code.

!!! HINT "Share code dojo results"
    Use a code sharing service such as GitHub / GitLab to share the code with the group and wider community, continuing the discussion and learning opportunity beyond the dojo event.

    [London Clojurians Org](https://github.com/ldnclj) is an example of a GitHub Organisation which the community shares there dojo experiences.

## Code Retreat

A group event where the same code challenge (code kata) is attempted over again with different pairs of people each time.

The group is organised into pairs (or trio's if there is an uneven number in the group).

Each pair starts the challenge from scratch and has a set time to attempt the solution (typically 45 - 60 minutes).

Pairs show and tell their approaches, with the ephasis on why a design was chosen.

After a short break, the group is organised into different pairs and the same challenge is attempted from scratch.

A retrospective is run at the end of the day, reflecting on the code retreat approach and designs shared throughout the day.

## Further thoughts

Deliberate practice is designed specifically to improve performance with the key word being ‘designed.’ The essence of deliberate practice is continually stretching an individual just beyond his or her current abilities. By contrast, deliberate practice requires that one identify certain sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved, and then work intently on them. The great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects of what they do and focus on just those things until they’re improved; then it’s on to the next aspect.

Deliberate practice can be repeated. High repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts. One is the choice of a properly demanding activity just beyond our current abilities. The other is the amount of repetition."

Feedback on results is continuously available. Though this is obvious, it is not nearly as simple as it might seem, especially when results require interpretation. In many important situations, a teacher, coach, or mentor is vital for providing crucial feedback.

It’s highly demanding mentally. Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it ‘deliberate.’ Continually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are unsatisfactory and then trying one’s hardest to make them better places enormous strains on anyone’s mental abilities. The work is so great that it seems no one can sustain it for very long.

It’s hard. This follows inescapably from the other characteristics of deliberate practice, which could be described as a recipe for not having fun. Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we’re good at, we insistently seek out what we’re not good at.

There is a definitive ‘before the work’ component. Self-regulation begins with setting goals – not big, life-directing goals, but more immediate goals for what you’re going to be doing today. In the research, the poorest performers don’t set goals at all; they just slog through their work. Mediocre performers set goals that are general and are often focused on simply achieving a good outcome. The best performers set goals that are not about the outcome but rather about the process of reaching the outcome.

There is a ‘during the work’ phase. The most important self-regulatory skill that top performers in every field use during their work is self-observation. Even in purely mental work, the best performers observe themselves closely. They are able to monitor what is happening in their own minds and ask how it’s going. Researchers call this metacognition – knowledge about your own knowledge, thinking about your own thinking. Top performers do this much more systematically than others do; it’s an established part of their routine.

There is an ‘after the work’ component as well. Practice activities are worthless without useful feedback about the results. These must be self-evaluations and the best performers judge themselves against a standard that’s relevant for what they’re trying to achieve. Sometimes they compare their performance with their own personal best; sometimes they compare it with the performance of competitors they’re facing or expect to face; sometimes they compare it with the best known performance by anyone in the field.
