# Deliberate Practice

We learn by doing, but we need to do something many times before it becomes instinctive or ingrained.  Deliberate practice is about doing something in order to learn rather than produce a finished product

In studies of accomplished individuals, researchers have found few signs of precocious achievement before the individuals started intensive training. Similar findings have turned up in studies of musicians, tennis players, artists, swimmers, mathematicians, and others.

Deliberate practice is a specific and unique kind of activity, neither work nor play. It’s characterised by several elements that together form a powerful whole.

Most fundamentally, what we generally do…. isn’t designed by anyone to make us better at anything. Usually it isn’t designed at all: We are just given an objective that’s necessary to meeting the employer’s goals and then expected to get on with it.

Working on a software project under deadlines and other pressures detracts from what you can learn, unless you take the time to setp back from the "doing" and "deadline".  Coding dojo and coding kata are not aimed at being an effective way to develop a software product, they are training tools to help you learn and improve your skills effectively.

By attending a coding dojo on a regular basis will gain a lot of experiences that will help you become more effective when working on projects.  A coding dojo helps developers become comfortable with pair programming, and helps pair programming and promiscuous pairing happen at work.  At a coding dojo you will also lean a great deal from the practical experience of others, things that people forget they know or do almost instinctively.




## Further thoughts

Deliberate practice is designed specifically to improve performance with the key word being ‘designed.’ The essence of deliberate practice is continually stretching an individual just beyond his or her current abilities. By contrast, deliberate practice requires that one identify certain sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved, and then work intently on them. The great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects of what they do and focus on just those things until they’re improved; then it’s on to the next aspect.

Deliberate practice can be repeated. High repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts. One is the choice of a properly demanding activity just beyond our current abilities. The other is the amount of repetition."

Feedback on results is continuously available. Though this is obvious, it is not nearly as simple as it might seem, especially when results require interpretation. In many important situations, a teacher, coach, or mentor is vital for providing crucial feedback.

It’s highly demanding mentally. Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it ‘deliberate.’ Continually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are unsatisfactory and then trying one’s hardest to make them better places enormous strains on anyone’s mental abilities. The work is so great that it seems no one can sustain it for very long.

It’s hard. This follows inescapably from the other characteristics of deliberate practice, which could be described as a recipe for not having fun. Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we’re good at, we insistently seek out what we’re not good at.

There is a definitive ‘before the work’ component. Self-regulation begins with setting goals – not big, life-directing goals, but more immediate goals for what you’re going to be doing today. In the research, the poorest performers don’t set goals at all; they just slog through their work. Mediocre performers set goals that are general and are often focused on simply achieving a good outcome. The best performers set goals that are not about the outcome but rather about the process of reaching the outcome.

There is a ‘during the work’ phase. The most important self-regulatory skill that top performers in every field use during their work is self-observation. Even in purely mental work, the best performers observe themselves closely. They are able to monitor what is happening in their own minds and ask how it’s going. Researchers call this metacognition – knowledge about your own knowledge, thinking about your own thinking. Top performers do this much more systematically than others do; it’s an established part of their routine.

There is an ‘after the work’ component as well. Practice activities are worthless without useful feedback about the results. These must be self-evaluations and the best performers judge themselves against a standard that’s relevant for what they’re trying to achieve. Sometimes they compare their performance with their own personal best; sometimes they compare it with the performance of competitors they’re facing or expect to face; sometimes they compare it with the best known performance by anyone in the field.
