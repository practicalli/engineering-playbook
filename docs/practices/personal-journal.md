# Personal Journal

A simple way to quickly capturing  things you are learning as you are learning them.  It can become a central place for capturing important information, without the need to consider how to structure that information effectively.

A regular journal becomes a tool to reinforcing things you have learned in a language that you understand them (your own).

Creating a journal within a searchable tool provides an essential reference, reducing the need to "re-learn" things you have learnt.
