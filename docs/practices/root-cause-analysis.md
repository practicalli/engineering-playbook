# Root Cause Analysis

When there is a problem at work it can be difficult to get beyond immediate symptoms and neglect addressing the underlying causes. Tackling the symptoms rather than the cause results in fixing the same kinds of problems time and time again.  This is often referred to as “fire-fighting”.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a widely used technique that helps people get beyond the symptoms of a problem and reveal the, often hidden, and multiple root causes.

RCA is built on the principle that causal relationships exist for all events. By understanding these we can move beyond the symptoms and address the root causes at source.

!!! HINT "Causes can be complex"
    When multiple causes are contributing to the issue, consider which of those issues would make the most significant impact if addressed.


## RCA Processes

There are a variety of Root Cause Analysis processes to choose from, some are quick and easy, such as 5 Whys, others are longer and more complex such as FMEA and Ishikawa. The Sologic RCA methodology is quick to learn, logical and scalable.  It is also universal in that it can be applied to any problem, in any sector.
