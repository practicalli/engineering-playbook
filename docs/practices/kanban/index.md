# Kanban

![Kanban concepts](https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/engineering-playbook/kanban-concepts.png?raw=true){align=right loading=lazy}

A lean approach to organising tasks and continually improving ways of working

Kanban encourages teams to

- visualise the work of the team (kanban board)
- review and optomise they way the work
- limit work in progress & task switching (stop starting and start finishing)
- flow
  - define work in consistent sizes (a day to a week)
- think of work as a value driven system
- pull system from the end of the workflow to the start

!!! INFO "Theory of Constraints"
    The theory of constraints is a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints

## Visualising work

A kanban board visualises the flow of tickets through a workflow, highlighting any number of factors

- status of work (todo, doing, done or more involved steps)
- who is working on the ticket
- history of the ticket (moving backward and forward between states shows churn)
- limits for work in progress (limited WIP), limits on particular workflow steps (e.g. doing) or limits on type of tickets
