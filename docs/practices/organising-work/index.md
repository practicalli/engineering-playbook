# Organising Work

Organising work is important as it ensures the right work is done at the right time for a valuable outcome.

Organising (usually referred to as planning) is not valued by engineers when the focus is predominantly "how long will it take to do x".  Unless an engineer has done 'X' many times before with the same constraints, then the answer can only be a rough guess.  Worse still is when a non-engineering role says with seeming confidence that it will only take a couple of weeks to do "X".

Organising work priorities can be very complex and have many stakeholders with different opinions about what is important.  It is vital that stakeholders resolve their own differences of opinions without taking valuable time away from engineering teams.

Time is also a major stakeholder in every engineering project.
