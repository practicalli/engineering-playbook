# Reports

When a report it required then the person creating that report should know what its value is and who is the audience.




## Identify reports

If repeating reports are required to be delivered, they should be identified as early as possible.

Capture the value the report provides and the stakeholders that will consume the report.

Ask those consuming each report what they really want to see and how often.

Also consult as to the presentation of the information to ensure that the information can be consumed effectively.

## Identify source data

What information is used to generate the report.

Identify related information that could be useful to the stakeholders and provide examples to stakeholders for feedback.

## Optomise Creation

Ensure that data capture and transformation for the report is as automated as possible, minimising the time it takes to generate each report.

Optomise the report format to best suit the methods of consumption by the stakeholders.
