Leadership is about owning the responsibility for the collective actions of a group or organisation as a whole.

Leaders should be inspirational and motivational, encouraging the people they lead to use and maximise their skills for the benefit of the organisation and themselves.

An effective leader

- exudes empathy for others which increases levels of communication and trust
- has situational awareness and takes an holistic approach to challenges and solutions
- effectively communicates vision and direction across all people and teams
- a source of inspiration to all those around them
- supports people to bring out the best of them, increasing employee satisfaction


An organisation becomes more effective when leaders can take a predominantly [servant-leader approach](#servant-leadership) role, dedicating themselves to those they are responsible for.


??? WARNING "Anti-pattern: Control"
    It is an illustion that people can be controllled, certainly not without violent action. 

    Actions that attempt to drive control over others distroy trust and greatly limit communication.  Given all collaborative work relies on trust and communication, that work will eventually fail.

    Micro-management demonstrates a derth of trust from leaders to those they should otherwise be nurturing.


??? WARNING "Anti-patter: Ego"
    Leadership should not be about one persons ego or career progression.

    Excessive ego is a sign of weakness.

    Taking sole credit for others work is an insideous action and such behaviour doesnt belong anywhere near a leadership position (or any one who considers themselves a decent human being)
