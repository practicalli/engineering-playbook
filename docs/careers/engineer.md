# Engineer role

!!! WARNING "Work in progress"

Most of the fundamental engineering skills are centered around communication and analysis (problem solving)

analysis:

- thinking
- problem solving
- learning (and relearning) concepts
- understanding the concepts & constraints of the chosen technology (programming language, architectural design, )
- balancing concerns to make the most appropriate recommendations and decisions

communication:

- Touch typing (effective source code and documentation)
- visualising concepts (a picture quickly conveys higher level concepts)
- explaining constraints (engineering is predominantly managing trade-offs and working in and around them)
- mentoring (sharing and relating your experiences to the current situation)
- leadership - bringing people long on a journey
