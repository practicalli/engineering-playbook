!!! INFO "Ownership verses Responsibility"

    Engineers have collective ownership of all source code and should feel encouraged to contribute to any aspect of the code (e.g. creating and reviewing Pull Requests)

    A team may have responsibility for specific components and services, ensuring their design goals are realised and maintained.  The team should guide other engineers in their use and contributions to the parts of source code they are responsible for.

    NOTE: From a legal perspective, the company you work for usually owns the code you write (explicitly defined in employment contracts).
