# Engineering Manager role

!!! WARNING "Work in progress"

Management roles are there to balance the needs of the organisation with the engineering teams ability to deliver

The role naturally focuses on on the larger goals and challenges facing the engineering teams, supporting the engineers to solve specific challenges using their own skills and experiences (that is why they were hired)

The Engineering Manager role can have a wide variation in scope of the role, especially in a startup environment.

The essence of the role is to ensure engineers:

- understand the responsibilities the company expects of them.
- have the information and tools required to work effectively
- support the growth of engineers


!!! TIP "Expectations may vary company to company"
    The EM role have varied wildly across all the companies I have worked for.  Some were very hands-on, some I never had chance to look at the code.

    Establishing what you percieve as the role scope within your organisation & team is important.  Without this clearly communicated then undiscussed expectations easily go unmet, leading to a poor outcome.

    When the scope is diverse, communicate the aspects you will focus on each month or each quarter.


## Meetings

[one to one](/engineering-playbook/practices/discussions/one-to-one-meeting.md) are regularly held with direct reports and those people the engineering manager reports to, ensuring there is good working relationship between the respective people.

- direct reports focus on supporting that persons ability to thrive within the company and identify actions to help

- stakeholders to ensure their concerns are understood and they have a realistic view of current capability from engineering teams

Engineering team meetings may occasionally be joined to review how effective the format is to those involved, or should a wider issue be addressed (especially in retrospectives)

- [standup](/engineering-playbook/practices/discussions/standup.md) can highlight issues with motivation and team cohesiveness
- [retrospective](/engineering-playbook/practices/discussions/retrospective.md) can help identify action items that the engineering manager can actively support or help direct others to support

!!! HINT "Performance reviews supported by one-to-one meetings"
    Where performance reviews are applicable, include the review as an aspect to raise with one-to-one meetings with direct reports throughout the year.

    The need to complete a review should be raised as early as possible in one-to-one meetings and regularly raised (even if only briefly) to ensure supporting tasks are carried out to swiftly complete the review at the appropriate time.

    Creating regular journal entries can speed up the completion of a self-written performance review submission

## Journal

Write regular journal entries and encourage others to do the same by sharing the journal across the organisation (except for private notes)

Use the knowledge sharing tool for the organisation, e.g. [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence){target=_blank}, [:globe_with_meridians: Notion](https://www.notion.so/){target=_blank}, [:globe_with_meridians: Tettra](https://tettra.com/){target=_blank}, etc.


!!! EXAMPLE "Example Journals"
    [Practicalli personal journal](https://practical.li/journal/) is a purposely unstructured journal to capture important but ad-hock information quickly, in a central place to it can easily be found and added too.


## Management anti-patters

**micro-management** is highly ineffective, demonstrates lack of trust, highlights poor communication and lack of management skills.  Shows lack of understanding of the needs of the business and engineering teams.

**overt control** suggests a lack of confidence, demoralises the team, incurs a lack of trust and engagement by team under control.  Drives inefficiency, stifles agency and creativity.

**emotional pain** degrading and emotionally attacking a person has no place in a positive relationship.

**dominating** by tearing people down to (allegedly) build them up in the (perceived) right way is an act of emotional torture and highly counter productive in the long term.


# Working with Product

Important relationship for and effective team

Ensures the work is readily understandable by the engineers on the team.

There should be clear goals to achieve (e.g. milestones) and a common understanding of what DONE looks like (and how to demonstrate DONE).

!!! EXAMPLE "Fintech Startup"
    - wrote a pitch to enhance API security by introducing HTTP Message Signatures (RFC9421)
    - reviewed and help simplify pitches created by the product manager, e.g. a new billing system and authorisation permissions and roles
    - introduced concept of engineering pitches to address technical debt and engineering concerns, expressing the value of this work to the business and ensuring the most concerning technical debt was alieviated


!!! WARNING "Avoid solutionising"
    Product requirements for a project should avoid providing a solution as this can be very distracting, especially if this leads the engineers on the team down an inappropriate approach.

    For example: Product suggested an API approach to an intricated billing system for a high volume service.  This would not have performed effectively and would have had a detrimental impact on the overall service.  A busy engineering team may have adopted this approach rather than seeking out existing services they could build a builing service upon (i.e. a ledger service).


## EM responsibility

The EM is ultimately responsible for everything the team does and agrees to do

- delivery of all work agreed
- Health and wellbeing of team
- Carrer progression of team members
- Onboarding new team members
- Rolling off new team members
- Overall quality of the platform
- Overall schedule of the team and meetings they attend

## product Manager
The PM for the team is ultimately responsible for providing clear guidance on business features required by Griffin customers.

- The Product owner should be aware of the respective value of any work proposed and any time frame in which this value is constrained by.
- Why is it valuable
- When is it valuable
- How is it valuable compared to other business features

## Work focus & cadence

Short term cycle
- 4 weeks product driven work
- 2 weeks engineering driven work
- Introduce goal keeper concept (based on need - initially engineering managers sole responsibility)

## Planning view

- 3 month high level goals
- 1 month plan overview
- 1 week detailed work

Priorities for product driven and engineering driven work agreed at start of week.

- Work broken down to small pieces, 1 day to 1 week.
- Epics used to orchestrate larger pieces





## Cycling analogy

### Onboarding

Create the basic engineering environment
- Getting a bike and making it ready for a ride
- Wearing the right clothes for the weather
- Food and snacks for the journey

### Starting as Engineer Manager

(analogy breaks down a bit)

- I have an idea of the destination, but not an exact route
- Discover several hills to climb (at the same time)
- Understanding organisation principles, practices and tools
- Understanding the team
- Understanding platform & products
- Understanding the needs of the business
- Identify where I can add value without detracting from delivery

### Reaching the destination

- Delivered what the business currently needs
- Climbing up each hill to be able to add value
- Identifying Where next?

Unless you work in a more traditional industry with clear staff hierarchies, it often unclear how to move up within your organization.

It can be even harder to decode in the technical division, where you need to decide if you want to try your hand at being an engineering manager (EM) or to get promoted without becoming a manager — or if you follow Honeycomb.io co-founder Charity Majors’s advice, continue on a pendulum back and forth between technical and management roles.

But what if your organization’s leaders instead had an intentional plan that helped identify the right tech talent to move into engineering manager roles? What if they provided the right level of onboarding, mentorship and training for managers? What if they guaranteed that if that developer doesn’t like being an engineering manager, they could return to their developer role?

That’s just what Katherine Spice, head of engineering at Octopus Electric Vehicles, laid out on the CTO Craft Con stage in London in March. She offered advice for identifying the right mix of people, culture, delivery and technology that helps build an engineering manager program at scale.

The Engineering Management Career Framework
“If you were to create a performance and career framework for your team, how would you go about it?” Spice asked the CTO Craft Con audience. “Where would you look?”

As an organization grows, it may develop a formal process for its workers’ career development. But career progression is always top of mind for tech talent.

To start establishing your own career framework, Spice advised starting with Progression.fyi, which Monzo created. It brings together 75 companies’ public and open source career frameworks.

Except that, Spice found, just nine of these mostly tech companies have an engineering management track.

“That’s less than 20% of frameworks from the ‘world’s best companies’ who actually think that engineering managers deserve and need explicit expectations and explicit career development from their organization,” she said. “I personally think that might be something of a crisis.”

Because people don’t leave bad jobs, they leave bad managers.

Add to this many organizations risk burnout of their current engineering leadership because they simply can’t connect with that many engineers anymore. When you reach that point, you really should have a clear pathway for both technical and non-technical progression.

In Spice’s experience, the hierarchy within a technical organization will go something like this, in descending order of authority:

CTO.
Vice president, director, head.
Senior engineering manager.
Engineering manager, individual contributors (ICs).
Engineering managers and individual contributors start at about the same level, but an EM can often benefit from going back to an IC and vice versa — that pendulum that Majors writes about. Smaller companies may jump from EM to the VP level or from senior EM to CTO, Spice said, but this is the general trajectory, with the number of people you are responsible for growing alongside your role within the company and your salary.

The 4 Parts of an Excellent Engineering Manager
An engineering manager’s responsibilities will vary by organization, but Spice categorizes them under four groupings:

People: retention, progression, psychological safety.
Culture: collaboration, processes, learning.
Delivery: velocity, release quality, value.
Technology: reliability, performance, roadmap.
How this role exists will vary by organization, Spice said, but typically an engineering manager will not be a technical decision-maker. That responsibility lies with the EM’s counterpart, the senior individual contributor, like a principal engineer or technical lead.

The People-Centric Engineering Manager
Some companies have EMs that work solely as people managers, meaning they are responsible for the performance and progression of the engineers they manage but are not responsible for the team’s technical delivery.

“This is really useful when you have changeable teams,” Spice said. “If you need the flexibility of an engineer hopping from project to project, or between teams for lots of reasons, then that person will retain continuity with their line manager, and that creates a lot of trust, and it allows the manager themselves to manage quite a lot of people.”

This is often seen as part of a software agency model, where some engineering managers will be responsible for internal team members, while others will be responsible for delivery and still others will be responsible for working with clients.

However, she warned, this people-focused engineering manager often lacks the cross-organizational view of the technical work. If there’s something your devs want to learn, it can be harder for this people-only role to help them find those opportunities for career development within the organization.

In Charge of People and Delivery
This is where the people/delivery EM is compelling, especially in companies smaller than enterprises.

This people/delivery managing model, Spice said, clarifies who is the single point of contact about performance. It also gives EMs experience managing individuals and teams. Developers know where and how to get feedback, with one key person who can help them improve and develop their careers.

“Where it can go a little bit wrong is if the engineering manager maybe isn’t super experienced, they might use one-to-ones to get status updates on the team performance,” Spice said. “The one-to-ones should still really focus on the individual, on their career development, on their progression, and team delivery should be handled through regular processes, planning, refinements, retros — whatever your individual rituals are.”

The Technical Engineering Manager
It’s hard to be accountable for delivery if you aren’t also accountable for technology.

Sometimes, Spice said, engineering managers are also responsible for a team’s technical strategy.

With this more technical engineering manager profile, she said, “when decisions are made by the team, the EM and the [project manager] particularly are having the technical tradeoff conversations between feature delivery and are addressing the technical roadmap. [Then] those decisions happen really close to the team’s activities.”

This is a huge benefit because then technical decisions are happening closer to the team and to the tech itself, which is another reason for all engineering managers to be technical, Spice argued. However, while these managers should be hands-on, maybe helping with glue work, they shouldn’t be writing code for a critical path.

“It’s really important when you’re hiring engineering managers, or when you work with engineering managers, that they can work closely with their engineers and actually understand what engineers are experiencing day to day,” Spice said.

“I don’t think that engineering managers need to be able to actually inspect lines of code written by their engineers. They certainly don’t need to be experts in every language that the team is working in. But they need to be able to have good, robust conversations, understand how to unblock if a [pull request] is bouncing back and forth.”

So long as they remember that their primary duty is to the people who are delivering the technology, this model of three — people, delivery and tech — she said, is a great way for an organization to set EMs up for long-term growth within the company as a technical leader.

“VPs, directors, CTOs, we are responsible for people, delivery and technology,” she said. “If you narrow an EM’s focus down to just people or to people and delivery, they are not gaining the experience for these more senior roles.”

The Cultural Power of an Engineering Manager Group
When engineering managers are brought together, they can then impact the culture of the engineering division.

By adding this fourth dimension of culture to the EM role, Spice said, processes are made better, including:

Hiring processes.
Best practices.
Guilds.
Team learning days and lunch-and-learns.
“They really become a scale factor,” she said, “and maybe start to coach and mentor each other with their different decisions and different experiences that they bring to it.”

Ideally, organizations will encourage engineering managers across all four dimensions, Spice said, but often different orgs will have different EM profiles. What’s most important is to be clear in what is expected for each role, fostering collaboration and cross-role knowledge sharing.

A Classic Build vs. Buy Decision
Organizations have to make a decision. Either they “build” EMs by fostering people with existing organizational domain, technical knowledge, culture fit and potential for leadership. Or they “buy” EMs, usually spending more money — but less time — on those that bring fresh perspective.

Neither is right or wrong, Spice said, but there are tradeoffs. That’s why she has created a build-versus-buy engineering manager framework.

‘Build’ EMs with Potential
The “build it” model has a much larger time investment than recruiting from the outside, but is a successful way to retain and foster talent within your organization.

“Fundamentally, the most important thing is knowledge,” Spice said. “These people, you already know. They’re a great culture fit. They already have good knowledge of the business domain and some, if not all, of the technical stack.

“It’s a really great thing for your organization to retain people and get them into additional roles have that career development within your organization. And, for those people, having opportunities to try different things, learn different things, is a super powerful aspect of retention.”

But you don’t want to set up your successful engineers to falter in managerial roles they don’t want. Spice outlined some green flags that indicate developers could be ready and right to take the management route:

They are actively engaged in helping those around them.
Without prompting, they provide good, positive, actionable feedback in team ceremonies.
They look to lead ceremonies.
When doing story or task breakdowns, they simplify and get to value quickly.
They are delivery-focused.
They have relationships outside the team or department, perhaps even with business stakeholders.
They consider business goals when they consider what the team is going to work on.
Above all else, ask if the developer in question wants to be an engineering manager. The last thing you want to do is to take someone away from a team they are helping be successful and then put them in a role they’ll hate. But sometimes you need to give a little push, or ask repeatedly.

One way to better set them up for success, Spice advised, is to make it the role change reversible. You don’t want to move someone from success in one role to set them up for failure in another.

“The worst case scenario is that they do it, they hate it — and they don’t tell you when they leave,” Spice said.

So, kick off with a shadowing pilot, where you allow engineers to trail EMs. Not in one-on-ones or private conversations, she clarified, but enough to get a good idea of what a day in the life of an engineering manager is.

Then, if they want to move into an EM role, set a probation period — maybe six months. But instead of leaving the company if things don’t work out, they can move back to being an engineer. It may not be on the same team, but guarantee them the same level and salary as before. That knowledge from the previous team and the EM experience will only serve to benefit their new engineering team.

On the other hand, Spice said, it’s best if the candidate doesn’t become engineering manager of their existing team. It’s simply too hard to step away from the work they’re already doing, and new EMs often end up juggling two roles.

“If you can’t give them a different team, be really, really explicit with them that you do not expect them to be writing code,” she said. “You do not expect them to be solving engineering problems.”

Provide them with support: “Think about creating a structure where one of your existing senior EMs can take them on as a direct report and provide them with space and scope for their development.”

‘Buy’ by Recruiting From the Outside
“You bring in fresh, new experience and new energy,” when you externally recruit, Spice said. “Honestly, it’s a great thing to have somebody from outside come in. What you’re looking for is all about their experience, and the hiring process is key.”

The biggest risk for this external process is that they don’t work out. That’s somewhat mitigated by a probation period, but before they’re hired, she said, make sure these engineering management candidates undergo multiple interviews across her four EM quadrants. In addition, have them facilitate mock technical interviews with your principal or staff engineers, as well as talk to people in your delivery process like project managers.

Make sure to include questions that deal with people challenges, with the Context > Action + Result model, Spice said, and even do a “weird and awkward role play.” She wants to see how these candidates handle tricky situations.

All these will help de-risk this buy decision.

This recruitment process will likely cost more money up front, and these outsiders changing companies will probably have higher salaries than an engineer that you promote from within. Spice predicts, however, it ends up evening out with the extra time you put in mentoring your internal promotions.

Set Your New EM Up for Success
Build versus buy is neither here nor there if you aren’t setting your new engineering managers up to succeed. That success must be measurable.

Of course, retention rate and progress are important, but they are lagging metrics, often too late, especially if a new EM is faltering.

“Look for factors that indicate psychological safety, particularly the feedback that’s being given [by them] and being given about them,” Spice recommended. Ask their direct reports what they think and run team health checks every week or two.

Then, since you should already be measuring the more traditional leading metrics, see how they change with this new manager, including:

Delivery.
Velocity.
Release quality.
Value.
As they get settled into the role, Spice would expect these new EMs to create a technology roadmap. How is their team delivering against that roadmap?

Beyond the people and technology, don’t forget the process:

Across team collaboration, are there process improvements?
Are you seeing a learning culture develop?
Are you seeing teammates offering to share things they’ve learned?
Continue to advise and mentor your engineering managers, helping them identify and fill any gaps they have across the four quadrants. This is an essential piece missing from most companies’ career progression maps, which is a shame, Spice said. As they manage up, down and sideways, engineering managers are your future CTOs.

“They are force multipliers,” she said. “If they’re unsupported, they can do quite a lot of damage, but if they are properly supported and properly invested in, then they can really supercharge your work and really help you be successful.”
